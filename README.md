<h1>Redux / Styled Components / React Transition Group</h1>

In this project I combined Styled Components with React Transition Group. Also Redux is very powerfull when you use same data with different situations.

Styled components very easy to use. I combined it with React Transition Group. Whit this combo I could animate the Color and SelectedColor components right before they unmounted.

I took help from 'some' function when I showed user whether is there any seleceted color or not.
